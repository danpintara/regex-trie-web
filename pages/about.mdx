In development of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BaritoLog">BaritoLog</a>, sometimes, we need to **silence multiple alerts** because of several reasons, e.g. we do mass-migration of containers, etc.

It will be a problem if we silence the whole app group like this because **we won’t be noticed if there’s something wrong during migration**, e.g. Kafka lag, etc.

```
app_group=~"xxda|xxbo|xxba|xxtzu|xxso|xxra|xxpo|xxpa|xxmu|xxme"
```

Instead of silencing the whole app group, we tried to **reduce the silence scope** by specifying IP addresses in regular expression like this:

```
instances=~"xxx.xx.44.52|xxx.xx.46.32|xxx.xx.47.93|xxx.xx.53.123|xxx.xx.53.185|xxx.xx.53.193|xxx.xx.53.198|xxx.xx.53.208|xxx.xx.53.235|xxx.xx.53.48|xxx.xx.53.99|xxx.xx.54.111"
```

Quite long, huh? **It’ll overflow** the <a target="_blank" href="https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager">AlertManager</a> field which doesn’t look nice. How about simplifying it to be something like this?

```
instances=~"xxx.xx.(4(4.52|6.32|7.93)|5(3.(1(23|85|9[38])|2(08|35)|48|99)|4.111))"
```

Introducing, **Regex Trie Web**. I made a small tool here so we can just copy the items in line and it will simplify it even while you’re typing.

Hope it will also help to solve your problems. Cheers!
